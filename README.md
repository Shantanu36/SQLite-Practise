# SQLite-Practise
Practicing some standard SQL commands in SQLite over a XAMPP Server.

SQLite is a database engine. It is software that allows users to interact with a relational database. In SQLite, a database is stored in a single file â€” a trait that distinguishes it from other database engines. This fact allows for a great deal of accessibility: copying a database is no more complicated than copying the file that stores the data, sharing a database can mean sending an email attachment.
